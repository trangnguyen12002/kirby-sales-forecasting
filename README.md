# About 
ðŸ”® Kirby Sales Forecasting Model is a continuous project focused on boosting sales revenue by predicting opportunity outcomes based on projected closing dates. With a current accuracy rate of 76% as determined by the ROC score, this project aims to offer a Python-centric guide for constructing a time series classification model. This is particularly valuable as R-based approaches are more prevalent in the field, and this project provides an alternative for Python developers.
